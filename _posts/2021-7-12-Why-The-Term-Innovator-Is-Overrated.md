If you know me in any capacity, you know that I consider myself an innovator- and that I use this word quite frequently. More and more, I see the **innovator** buzzword taking over headlines, job postings and descriptions, LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos, etc. To be honest, I often wonder if these content creators even know what innovation is. 

## What is an "innovator"?

Through a quick Google search, an innovator is defined as "a person who introduces new methods, ideas, or products." Innovation culture has grown enormously over the last decade or so as future potential has driven significant human and technological progress. Engineers, entrepreneurs, insitutitions, companies- big and small- have all been driving straight for the "next best thing" in whatever industry applies. 

## Why is innovation overrated?

How often does someone instroduce something **new**? Well, I am not quite sure, but I can say with confidence we see much more progress in terms of building off an existing idea or platform, or creating a spinoff of another product. All of this work is very important, but it is also important to distinguish pioneers against other developments in tech. At this point, everyone is an innovator in some way, and the continual overuse of this term to situations that don't exactly apply (like engineering innovation internship), lessen the impact of the term overall.

## So, why don't you care?

Innovation lies in ability, willingness, and opportunity. Imposter syndrome is doubting your ability. Imposter syndrome disproportionately affects minority groups in tech- especially those who aim to make big strides and don't know how or have been shut down. Those with big goals and manifesting of disruptive tech, hard work, and giant leaps are truly innovators even if they don't think so. That descriptor was made for them. So hey, I am not building my own rocket to the moon. But my passions and aspirations to drive the future of clean energy or ethics in AI might have their own direct impact to that very rocket someone else will build. 

I still consider myself and innovator and hope that all my fellow techies celebrate their journey as innovators as well- regardless or who or whatever else is an innovator in their space as well!
